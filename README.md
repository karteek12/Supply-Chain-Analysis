# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis for Fashion & Beauty Startup
Welcome to the **Supply Chain Analysis** project! This project delves into a comprehensive supply chain analysis for a Fashion & Beauty startup focused on makeup products. The analysis is aimed at identifying trends, enhancing supply chain efficiency, and providing actionable insights to support strategic decision-making in inventory management, distribution, and demand forecasting.
## 🚀 Features
* Analyze product movement across the supply chain
* Identify bottlenecks, delays, and inventory levels
* Visualize product trends for better decision-making
* Provide actionable insights to optimize logistics and inventory management
## 📁 Dataset Overview
 I got this Dataset from Kaggle . This dataset contains 24 columns and 100 rows
 
**Some of the key features that my dataset contains are :-**
* **Product Type**: Category or type of the product (e.g. haircare , skincare , cosmetics)
* **Availability**: Current stock status 
* **Number of Products Sold**: Total units sold over a given period
* **Stock Levels**: Remaining inventory for each product
* **Lead Times**: Time taken for a product to reach customers
* **Production Volumes**: Quantity produced over a given time frame
* **Manufacturing Lead Time**: Time taken for the product to be manufactured
* **Manufacturing Costs**: Expenses associated with production
* **Inspection Results**: Outcome of quality checks (e.g., Pending , Passed , Failed)
  
## 🔬Methodology
* **Data Preprocessing** :
 Cleaned and structured the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
* **Market Analysis** :
 Conducted an analysis on demand trends and product performance.
* **Visualization** :
 Created visuals to represent sales trends, inventory levels, and demand forecasting for actionable insights.
* **Key Findings** :
  Identified top-performing products and regions, forecasted demand spikes, and pinpointed inefficiencies in the supply chain.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
* **Python**: Programming language for analysis
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
