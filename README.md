# 📊 Supply Chain Analysis using Python
Welcome to the **Supply Chain Analysis** project! This repository showcases the analysis of a fashion and beauty startup's product supply chain dataset using Python . The project provides valuable insights into the operations, inventory, and trends in the supply chain, helping identify key performance metrics.
## 🚀 Features
* Analyze product movement across the supply chain
* Identify bottlenecks, delays, and inventory levels
* Visualize product trends with Matplotlib for better decision-making
* Provide actionable insights to optimize logistics and inventory management
## 📁 Dataset Overview
 I got this Dataset from Kaggle . This dataset contains 24 columns and 100 rows
 
**Some of the key features that my dataset contains are :-**
* **Product Type**: Category or type of the product (e.g. haircare , skincare , cosmetics)
* **Availability**: Current stock status 
* **Number of Products Sold**: Total units sold over a given period
* **Stock Levels**: Remaining inventory for each product
* **Lead Times**: Time taken for a product to reach customers
* **Production Volumes**: Quantity produced over a given time frame
* **Manufacturing Lead Time**: Time taken for the product to be manufactured
* **Manufacturing Costs**: Expenses associated with production
* **Inspection Results**: Outcome of quality checks (e.g., Pending , Passed , Failed)

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
* **Python**: Programming language for analysis
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
* **Matplotlib**: Visualizing trends and patterns in the supply chain
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for data analysis

## 📈 Key Insights from the Analysis
* **Sales Trends**: Identified top-selling and underperforming products
* **Inventory Optimization**: Analyzed stock levels to prevent overstock or stockouts
* **Production Efficiency**: Evaluated manufacturing lead times and volumes
* **Cost Analysis**: Identified trends in manufacturing expenses
* **Quality Control**: Investigated inspection failures to enhance product quality
